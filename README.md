# APIMethodDocExtractionTool
This tool extracts the documentation for classes and methods in an Android API library and exports the documentation to 
a formatted text file. 

To use this to simply download the tool and run with "ApiDocExtract 'library url goes here' 'filename to extract to'"
Specifically, the 'library url' parameter should be the url to the package index page in the desired library.
This tool was designed for libraries from "developer.android.com"

Note: Still working on csv formatting and saving to file
